The current build script is currently extremely basic, meaning that not many
options are available.

This plugin can be installed by exectuting the following commands (assuming a
bash like shell is used and sudo is the preferred way of executing root
commands):

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake [options] ..
    make
    sudo make install

(If the installation directory is not a system directory, sudo is not needed)

Current available options are:

    -DUSE_MP=<TRUE|FALSE>      Whether multithreading support should be enabled.
    -DUSE_FFTW3=<TRUE|FALSE>   Whether the FFTW3 library should be used.
    -DNO_COMPLEX_BUILTIN=<TRUE|FALSE> If TRUE complex.h will not be used.
    -DPLUGIN_DIR="path"        Sets the installation directory.
